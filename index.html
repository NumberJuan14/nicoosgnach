      <div class = "project-box col-lg-6 col-md-12">
        <h2 class="project-heading">Projects</h2>
        <p>I have taken 4 years of high school computer science courses, including AP Computer Science Principles, AP Computer Science A, Computer Science 3: 
          Data Structures, and Computer Science Independent Study. 
          This combined with outside computer science courses have given me experience with Java, Python, C++, Javascript, C#, Visual Basic, Processing, HTML, Scratch, and CSS.</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "p-col col-lg-6 col-md-12">

            <h3 class = "project-title1">Frogger</h3>
               <p class = "info1">This was the first large project I completed in my Computer Science Data Structures class. The assignment took me 2 weeks with both work at home and at school. 
                This project mainly involved practice with threading, using update and render loops, 
                practice creating a functional timer to manage how long the frog had to make it to the end, as well as the duration for turtle shells to sink and resurface.</p>

          <h3 class = "project-title2">Binary Search Tree</h3>
          <p class = "info1">Although this may have been the toughest project to code in my Computer Science Data Structures Course in terms of logic, it paid off in the end due to the experience it gave me. 
            By throwing me in the deep end, this assignment significantly helped to ameliorate my understanding of recursion and storing/accessing data.

          <h3 class = "project-title3">3D Tic-Tac-Toe AI</h3>
          <p class = "info1">This was by far my favorite project as it delved into the very subject that I would like to specialize in with regards to computer science, artificial intelligence. 
            With this assignment I gained even more experience with recursion through the minimax algorithm to not just find the optimal move based on the current board, but also by looking ahead at potential outcomes. 
            I also incorporated alpha beta pruning to optimize the algorithm by decreasing the number of nodes it needed to analyze.

          <h3 class = "project-title4">Djikstras with Python</h3>
          <p class = "info1">After having done some practice with implementing BFS and DFS search algorithms for portal mazes I began working on writing a Djikstras algorithm for a weighted undirectred graph.
            By combining some previous knowledge from my data structures course with my newly acquired understanding of Python I was able to create an algorithm that found the shortest path and its weight to each node from the starting node
            that enhanced my understanding of both data structures and coding in Python.

          <h3 class = "project-title5">Mega Land with Python and Pygame</h3>
          <p class = "info1">For our first project for our Computer Science Independent Study course, my partner, Stephan Kalugin, and I, attempted to use our newfound knowledge of Python as well as some work with Pygame to code a “push your luck” board game called Megaland. 
            Though it went well at first we ended up running into a lot of trouble and logic errors in our code, mainly when it came to having to integrate our code, 
            due to our lack of sufficient knowledge of pygame.

            This fun project gave me experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript that was essential in improving my web-development skills.
